# Text to Speech Discord Bot

Discord bot for tts that auto plays after a `speak` command message is sent.  
It uses opus audio files and a free tts php api (will migrate to google later).  

Written in go for fun and the speed :)  

It's still a WIP but it works.
## TODO
- [ ] Add dependencies and go modules
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile to run inside a container
- [ ] Migrate to Google TTS api.
